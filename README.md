# Screen reader testing
Move beyond trivial screen reader testing and instead test an entire workflow. Can a user navigate and traverse several workflows to complete a task?

7 tests in total with the first 4 navigational waypoints, followed by 3 tests interacting with elements as part of the workflow.

## Orientation and waypoint finding
1. `Does the screen reader output matches the visual output of all headings`
1. `Does the screen reader output matches the visual output of all links (as a minimum)`
1. `Does the screen reader output matches the visual output of all list elements`
1. `Does the screen reader output the first 2 rows of a table and announces the columns`

## User actions and workflow traversal
5. `Does the screen reader output every visual error message`
6. `Does the screen reader output all significant page activity (spinner icons appearing, new page content)`
7. `Does the screen reader output a controls outcome (collapsed/expanded, x number of items returned)`
